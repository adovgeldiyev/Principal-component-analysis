## Software used R <br>
Problem 4 (Principal Component Analysis - 20 points): The data given in the file ‘Big5.csv’ are 5-point Likert items taken from the Big Five Personality Test web-based personality assessment. Techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used to determine different types of personalities.<br>
A) How many components are need to explain 100% of total variation for this data? How many components are determined from the scree plot? What number of components would you use in the model?<br>
B) For the number of components in part A, give the formula for each component and a brief interpretation after rotating the components. What names might you give for each of the components?<br>
C) What subjects have the highest and lowest values for each principal component (only include the number of components specified in part A. For each of those subjects, give the principal component scores (again only for the number of components specified in part A).<br>
D) Finally, run a common factor analysis on the same data. What difference, if any, do you find? Does the factor analysis change your ability to interpret the results practically?<br>
